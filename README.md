The objective of this task is to understand how the KNN algorithm works as an instance-based learning technique that classifies new data points based on the majority class among its K nearest neighbors. The dataset used contains measurements of iris flowers' features such as petal and sepal dimensions, along with their species. The features were first normalized using StandardScaler to ensure fair distance calculations, which are essential in KNN. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and a KNN classifier was trained using scikit-learn. Multiple values of K were tested to determine the best performance, and accuracy was evaluated for each. The final evaluation included a confusion matrix and classification report to measure precision, recall, and F1-score. A plot of accuracy versus K was generated to visualize the impact of K on model performance. This task also helped in understanding the role of distance metrics, the effect of K value on bias-variance tradeoff, and how to handle multi-class classification using KNN. All code, dataset files, and visual outputs are included in this repository.
